# Todo Application with ReactJS

This project is a simple Todo application built using ReactJS with functional components. It allows users to add, update, and delete notes in a straightforward and intuitive interface.

## Features

### 1. Add Notes
You can easily add new notes to the Todo application. There's a validation mechanism in place to ensure that notes cannot be empty. If you attempt to add an empty note, a warning will be displayed, prompting you to enter valid content.

### 2. Update Notes
Once you've added notes to the application, you have the option to update them. Click on the "Update" icon/button associated with the note you want to modify. This action will open an edit field where you can make changes to the note's content.

### 3. Delete Notes
Deleting notes is a straightforward process in this Todo application. Simply click on the "Delete" icon/button next to the note you want to remove, and the note will be permanently deleted from your list.

### 4. List of Todo Notes
The application displays a list of all your Todo notes. If there are no notes in the application, it will show a warning message indicating that the list is empty. This helps you keep track of your tasks effectively.
